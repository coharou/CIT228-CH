They were on a street which seemed to run on forever, 
mile after mile -- thirty-four of them, 
if they had known it -- and each side of it one 
uninterrupted row of wretched little two-story frame buildings.
Down every side street they could see, it was the same --
never a hill and never a hollow, but always the same
endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings.'
